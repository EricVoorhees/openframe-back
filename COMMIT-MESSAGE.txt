feat: Prepare backend for Render deployment

Critical fixes and optimizations for production deployment:

- Add go.work file for Go workspace configuration
- Fix Dockerfile to properly copy go.work (remove wildcard)
- Configure config.go to read PORT environment variable (Render compatibility)
- Optimize render.yaml to use Render's auto-assigned PORT
- Create .env file for local development testing

Documentation added:
- RENDER-DEPLOYMENT-READY.md - Comprehensive deployment guide
- QUICK-START-RENDER.md - 5-minute quick start guide
- DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY.md - Technical summary of changes

Backend is now ready to:
✅ Build successfully on Render
✅ Start on dynamic PORT
✅ Respond to health checks at /api/v1/health
✅ Persist data with mounted disk
✅ Handle CORS for frontend integration

Tested: Docker build, health endpoint, configuration
Ready for: Production deployment to Render.com
